# Wholesome Club Extensions (WCE) v6.3

* added a new feature to Layering menus: [WCE] configure layer hiding
  * this lets you override which other layers a items hides (cloths over a shiny petsuit anyone?)
  * only useable by WCE users on other WCE users (or yourself)
  * only visible to other WCE users (and yourself)
  * no stored in your appearance on BC servers, but instead in WCE settings
  * not available for crafting yet (for above reason)
  * requires BC R105
* added an option to prevent other (WCE) users from making layering changes to your character
* you won't be able to access the layering menu for locked items, which you can't unlock, even with the `allow layering menus while bound` option
* added BC R105 support
  * complete rewrite of the Anti Garble Chat Options using the new DOM based APIs (click the arrow next to the send chat button to access them)
  * removed the `show whisper button on chat messages` options, as it's replaced with something better in BC (clicking on highlighted names)
  * many more fixes related to the new BC version
* added `/ulistadd`, `/ulistremove` and `/ulistshow` commands to manage a whitelist of users, who could bypass Uwall
* created a new documentation website: https://wce-docs.vercel.app/
  * it has a [Garble Simulator](https://wce-docs.vercel.app/docs/anti-garbling/simulator) too, which let you easily try out all anti garble options with different gag intensities
  * (for the devs) there is also a [BC API typedoc website](https://bc-typedoc.vercel.app/), here an [typedoc for `Layering`](https://bc-typedoc.vercel.app/api/namespace/Layering)
* migrate over half of the project to TypeScript for better maintainability (to be continued in the next releases)
* changed app icon (to fit more into BC icon theme)
* chat embeds for images are now working with uppercase file extensions too (which are technically incorrect, but browsers are less strict about them too)
* fixed an error with the `/w` command, when trying to whisper yourself
* improved linting, release building, CI/CD
