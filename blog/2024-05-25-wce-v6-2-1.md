# Wholesome Club Extensions (WCE) v6.2.1

* improved Anti Garble system ([read the updated docs](https://github.com/KittenApps/WCE/wiki/Anti-Garble-system))
  * improved controll over `stutter` and `baby talk`
    * in addition to always remove and always preserve you can now set it to the new option:
    * `ignore`: do not show an ungarbled message (in brackets) if no other garbling effects are applied, but otherwise removes it from the ungarbled message
  * hide ungarbled message if it's exactly the same as the garbled one
  * let you control `stutter` and `baby talk` options directly in the chat options menu
  * improved anti garble option tooltips in the WCE settings
  * integrate WCE's own `Alternate speech stutters` better into the game and into WCE's Anti Garble system
    * by updating the hook and reporting back appplied effects
    * fixes stutters being applied twice (both BC's and WCE's one)
    * the anti garble system supports now WCE's stutters too (in removing and preserving)
* Local Wardrobe (thanks cute outfit hoarding puppy Stacey for the idea \<3)
  * extends the Wardrobe by an additional 288 slots saved locally on your device (page 9-32)
  * unlike the online section of the Wardrobe (page 1-8), the local wardrobe isn't synced between your different devices, but alts on the same device share the same Local Wardrobe
  * fix blurry effect being applied to WCE's Wardrobe previews
* encrypt `Saved Logins` credentials with a non exportable AES-GCM-256 key
  * no more storing them in plaintext in `localStorage` (moved to `IndexedDB`)
* upgrade Buttplug.io version to the latest 3.x (for toySync)
  * fixes some incompatibility issues with recent Intiface releases
  * allow setting a custom Intiface server address (now you can connect to Intiface on your phone in the same network)
* WCE is now on FUSAM (WCE's loaders still have some `modulepreload` optimizations to reduce the time until you can access your Saved Logins by ~50%)
* improved bundling of the WCE using Rollup (reducing bundle size)
  * enabled code splitting to ship our own package for our dependencies
  * upgrade Dexie version to 4.0.5
  * move base64 encoded icons out of the bundle and load them as optimized png's
* other smaller fixes and improvements
  * upgrade linting stack to latest Eslint 9
  * support checking hashes for nested functions
  * preliminary layering fix for r105
  * hide pagination button in WCE settings if there is only 1 page
